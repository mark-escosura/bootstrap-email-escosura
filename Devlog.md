- Thinking how I should approach this project
- Thinking about using a test-driven-development approach since I am given a project requirement.
- Brainstorming ideas for a wireframe for the project
- Found this AI-powered UI Wireframe generator and signed up for the free trial: [UX Pilot](https://uxpilot.io)
- I also used Figma to recreate the wireframe that was generated by the AI-powered UI Wireframe (for practice)

- I was having some accessibility issues within the header portion, so I fixed it using Bootstrap CSS
- Buttons: Text disappears in mobile screen sizes but icons stay
- Added a search bar in the header
- Added a textarea inside the email body portion
- Added basic JavaScript functionality that updates the email body dynamically when a user clicks on a certain email under the inbox column
