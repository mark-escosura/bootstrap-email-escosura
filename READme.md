# Bootstrap Grid Project - Create a Responsive Email Template (Version 2.0)

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a responsive email template using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap Grid system. The goal is to design an email template that adjusts across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where tests are written before the actual code to ensure each requirement is met.

## Project Requirements

    •	HTML and CSS structure using Bootstrap Grid for responsiveness.
    •	At least three columns with Bootstrap classes.
    •	At least two unique Bootstrap components (e.g., buttons, lists).
    •	Functional Compose and Reply buttons.
    •	A responsive design that adjusts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
    •	Code must be clean, well-organized, and free of duplication.
    •	External stylesheet used (no inline styles).
    •	Responsive design for various breakpoints.
    •	GitHub repository with clear class names and no inline CSS.

## Basic Project Structure

    •	Create the following files and directories:

            bootstrap-email-escosura/
            ├── index.html          # Main HTML file
            ├── styles.css          # External stylesheet

            │   ├── index.test.js   # Jest test file
            └── package.json        # Package configuration
